### Repository information

This repository contains all the code needed to reproduce the results of our recent manuscript and will be archived after the manuscript is published.
Also included in this repository are the raw results (MSI scores, summary statistics, etc.).
To access the distributable version of the SC-MSI pipeline visit https://github.com/harrison-anth/sc_msi

Note: Each directory in this repository might have a deprecated/old code or files folder. These, while useful for archival purposes and transparency, were not used in the final results for the manuscript.
